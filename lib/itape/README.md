# itape

An interactive tape runner.

## Ideas

`itape --fail` Only runs tests that have previously failed

`itape --trace` Runs tracing mode using DEBUGLOG

`itape` effectively a `node` alias.

`itape --debug` Only runs tests that have previously failed
    and sets a breakpoint for every failing test.
